      <h1>FUCK ISRAEL, STAND WITH PALESTINE, CEASE FIRE NOW</h1>
      <p>hi, if you're an ip camera owner seeing this, i have """hacked""" your camera.</p>
      <p>if you're from israel, i did it because i looked through cameras on <a href="http://insecam.org">insecam</a> under the israel country tag.<br>why? it's because israel has been killing palestinians for literal years and the second they fought back, they pretended they were a victim.<br>the sad part is that people fucking believe this shit. for example my grandma stands with israel, even after i told them what happened.</p>

      <p>if you're not from israel and are a victim of my """hacking""", i have not changed the password. this even applies to the israel cameras i've hacked.</p>
      <p>if you're not from israel and just came here because you saw it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Unsecured_CCTV">@Unsecured_CCTV</a>, welcome. also, <a href="https://arab.org/click-to-help/palestine/">don't forget to do your daily click!</a></p>
